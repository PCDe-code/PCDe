# PCDE
This is the code of a personalized conversational debiasing framework (PCDe) for next POI recommendation with uncertain check-ins. By leveraging the advantages of conversational techniques, PCDe captures personalized dynamic user preferences, enabling it to effectively mitigate both scale and popularity biases at a personalized level.
