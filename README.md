# PCDE
This is the code of a personalized conversational debiasing framework (PCDe) for next POI recommendation with uncertain check-ins. We propose a personalized conversational debiasing framework for next POI recommendation with uncertain check-ins, equipped with two delicately designed components to mitigate scale bias and popularity bias.


## Pre-requisits
